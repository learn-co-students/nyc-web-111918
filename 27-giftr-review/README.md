# Giftr™

Welcome to Giftr™! Please build out the following features **without persistence**. We'll just be focusing on DOM CRUD without persisting any changes to a server.

- In `src/giftData.js` is all the gift data. Build out the following features:

  - A user should be able to see all of the gift data on initial page load
  - A user should be able to search for and filter particular gifts with names that _include_ a particular search query.
  - A user should be able to delete a particular gift
  - A user (any user, don't worry about authorization) should be able to edit a gift's details



### For Review

- HTML collection
  - Array.from

- Events in general
  - event target
  - event delegation
  - careful w/ nested event listeners
  - datasets in general
